# SM4SHCommand
SM4SHCommand is a fully featured IDE for modifying and compiling moveset scripting code for Smash 4. The application is currently undergoing a substantial rewrite so many features are either unimplemented or WIP.

 - **Features**
   - Projects and Workspaces system, similar to Visual Studio's Projects and Solution files.
   - Extensible and modular Project Templates system for allowing users to create custom project directory frameworks.
   - TreeView based editor system means simple and easy workflow, simply double click on any file and an appropriate editor will be opened
   - Leverages the FITX Smash 4 Compiler platform for powerful editing of scripts in source code format as opposed to editing the binaries directly as in previous versions
   - Basic code completion for script files
   - Syntax Highlighting for script files
